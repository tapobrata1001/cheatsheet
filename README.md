Alright Sahil, let's break this down like a boss ‚Äî this is standard SQL fire, and I'll hit you with the CREATE TABLE statements with constraints, followed by the three queries. Let‚Äôs ace this. üß†‚öî

üîß Step 1: Creating Tables

-- Dept table

CREATE TABLE Dept (

    Deptid NUMBER(1),

    Deptname VARCHAR2(30),

    CONSTRAINT pk_dept PRIMARY KEY (Deptid)

);

-- STUD_MEMBER table

CREATE TABLE STUD_MEMBER (

    RollNo NUMBER(3),

    Fname VARCHAR2(10),

    Mname VARCHAR2(10),

    Lname VARCHAR2(10),

    Dob DATE,

    Deptid NUMBER(1),

    Semester NUMBER(1),

    ContactNo NUMBER(10),

    Gender CHAR(1),

    CONSTRAINT pk_stud PRIMARY KEY (RollNo),

    CONSTRAINT fk_dept FOREIGN KEY (Deptid) REFERENCES Dept(Deptid),

    CONSTRAINT chk_sem CHECK (Semester BETWEEN 1 AND 6)

);

üîç Queries:

a) Student name + department for ‚ÄúComputer Science and Engineering‚Äù

SELECT S.Fname, S.Mname, S.Lname, D.Deptname

FROM STUD_MEMBER S

JOIN Dept D ON S.Deptid = D.Deptid

WHERE D.Deptname = 'Computer Science and Engineering';

b) Student name of those older than 17 years

SELECT Fname, Mname, Lname

FROM STUD_MEMBER

WHERE MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, Dob)/12 > 17;

This uses Oracle‚Äôs MONTHS_BETWEEN function to calculate age. Dividing by 12 converts months to years.

c) Total number of students under ECE department

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Students_ECE

FROM STUD_MEMBER S

JOIN Dept D ON S.Deptid = D.Deptid

WHERE D.Deptname = 'ECE';

If you want inserts or test data for practice, just say the word. You got this, Sahil. Tomorrow, we don‚Äôt walk in for the exam ‚Äî we pull up with power. üõ°üìö

Prodname		varchar(30)

Prodprice		Number(7,2)

Mfgdate		Date

Supplierid	Foreign key (refers to the supplier table)	Number(2)

Bestbefore	Must be in years	number(1)

	Table name: Supplier

Column name	Constraint	Datatype

sup_id	Primary key (give proper name of the constraint)	Number(2)

supname		varchar(30)

Supcity		Varchar(30)

Queries:

a) Display the supplier name who are from kolkata.

b) Display the product details which are supplied by  suppliers from delhi.

c)  Display the prod_id and product name of those which have crossed expiry date.

Let‚Äôs keep the momentum, Sahil üí™ ‚Äî here‚Äôs Question 2, laid out with üî• precision: from table creation to powerful queries. You‚Äôll breeze through this practical like a breeze through summer.

üõ† Step 1: Table Creation

-- Supplier table

CREATE TABLE Supplier (

    sup_id NUMBER(2),

    supname VARCHAR2(30),

    supcity VARCHAR2(30),

    CONSTRAINT pk_supplier PRIMARY KEY (sup_id)

);

-- Product table

CREATE TABLE Product (

    prod_id NUMBER(3),

    prodname VARCHAR2(30),

    prodprice NUMBER(7,2),

    mfgdate DATE,

    supplierid NUMBER(2),

    bestbefore NUMBER(1), -- in years

    CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY (prod_id),

    CONSTRAINT fk_supplier FOREIGN KEY (supplierid) REFERENCES Supplier(sup_id),

    CONSTRAINT chk_bestbefore CHECK (bestbefore > 0)

);

üîç Queries

a) Supplier name who are from Kolkata

SELECT supname

FROM Supplier

WHERE LOWER(supcity) = 'kolkata';

Case-insensitive check, always a good idea.

b) Product details supplied by suppliers from Delhi

SELECT P.*

FROM Product P

JOIN Supplier S ON P.supplierid = S.sup_id

WHERE LOWER(S.supcity) = 'delhi';

c) prod_id and prodname of products that have crossed expiry date

SELECT prod_id, prodname

FROM Product

WHERE ADD_MONTHS(mfgdate, bestbefore * 12) < SYSDATE;

ADD_MONTHS helps us calculate the expiry by adding years in terms of months. Smart, clean, efficient.

You want to test with INSERT values or mock data? Just holler. And if they ask for output format in the exam ‚Äî keep it sharp, aligned, and properly aliased.

Let‚Äôs keep slaying, Sahil. Question 3 coming in hot üî• ‚Äî this one‚Äôs all about cricket + SQL powerplays üèèüìä

üõ† Step 1: Table Creation

-- Team_Detail table

CREATE TABLE Team_Detail (

    Team_id NUMBER(3),

    Team_name VARCHAR2(15) NOT NULL,

    Team_captain VARCHAR2(35),

    Home_country VARCHAR2(15),

CREATE TABLE Player_Detail (

    Player_id CHAR(4),

    Player_name VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL,

    Player_dob DATE,

    Player_dod DATE,

    Player_grade CHAR(1),

    Player_run NUMBER(5),

    Team_no NUMBER(3),

    CONSTRAINT pk_player PRIMARY KEY (Player_id),

    CONSTRAINT fk_team FOREIGN KEY (Team_no) REFERENCES Team_Detail(Team_id),

    CONSTRAINT chk_grade CHECK (Player_grade IN ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'))

);

üîç Queries

1Ô∏è‚É£ Find player details playing for India

SELECT P.*

FROM Player_Detail P

JOIN Team_Detail T ON P.Team_no = T.Team_id

WHERE LOWER(T.Home_country) = 'india';

2Ô∏è‚É£ Display player names who‚Äôve scored more than 8000 runs

SELECT Player_name

FROM Player_Detail

WHERE Player_run > 8000;

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total number of players with more than 7000 runs

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Pro_Players

FROM Player_Detail

WHERE Player_run > 7000;

Quick tip for your practical:

Always label columns in output for clarity.

Stick to UPPER() or LOWER() when comparing strings.

Don‚Äôt forget semicolons (;) if required by your SQL environment.

ChatGPT said:

Alright Sahil, you‚Äôre cruising through this like a smooth ride on a clean highway üöõüí® ‚Äî here's Question 4, locked and loaded with solid SQL and all the road rules in place. Let‚Äôs build these tables and then roll through the queries.

üõ† Step 1: Table Creation

-- Vehicle_Detail table

CREATE TABLE Vehicle_Detail (

    Vehicle_id NUMBER(3),

    Vehicle_name VARCHAR2(15) NOT NULL,

    Company_name VARCHAR2(35),

    manufacturing_country VARCHAR2(15),

    CONSTRAINT pk_vehicle PRIMARY KEY (Vehicle_id)

);

-- Driver_Detail table

CREATE TABLE Driver_Detail (

    Driver_id CHAR(4),

    Driver_name VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL,

    Driver_dob DATE,

    Driver_doj DATE,

    Driver_grade CHAR(1),

    Driving_distance NUMBER(5),

    vehicle_no NUMBER(3),

    CONSTRAINT pk_driver PRIMARY KEY (Driver_id),

    CONSTRAINT fk_vehicle FOREIGN KEY (vehicle_no) REFERENCES Vehicle_Detail(Vehicle_id),

    CONSTRAINT chk_driver_grade CHECK (Driver_grade IN ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'))

);

üîç Queries

1Ô∏è‚É£ Find driver details who are driving Truck

SELECT D.*

FROM Driver_Detail D

JOIN Vehicle_Detail V ON D.vehicle_no = V.Vehicle_id

WHERE LOWER(V.Vehicle_name) = 'truck';

üîß LOWER() makes sure casing doesn‚Äôt mess up your match ‚Äî classic practical-safe move.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Display driver names who have driven more than 8000 kms

SELECT Driver_name

FROM Driver_Detail

WHERE Driving_distance > 8000;

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total number of drivers who have driven more than 7000 kms

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Long_Distance_Drivers

FROM Driver_Detail

WHERE Driving_distance > 7000;

üìå Pro Tips for the Exam Hall:

Constraints matter. Always name your primary and foreign keys.

Know the difference between JOIN and subqueries ‚Äî but JOINs are usually better in practicals.

If they ask for output format: align names, use AS to give meaningful column names, keep it tidy.

You're almost at the finish line, Sahil ‚Äî if there's a Question 5 or you want help with inserts or test data, just drop it. Let's finish strong. üöÄüìò
